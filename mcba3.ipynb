    "# Analog to digital conversion\n",
    "\n",
    "The real world tends to result in analog signals. We need to convert these to digital numbers in order to analyse the results of experiments using a computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "E.g., suppose that you have a voltage that ranges between 0 and 10V. How do you represent this voltage as a digital number?\n",
    "\n",
    "Going digital implicitly means that there is some minimum delta in the analog signal that corresponds to a change of 1 in the digital number. So, one of the first decisions to make is: *what it the minimum delta that you need to resolve?* E.g., if the analog signal 0.00V is assigned the digital number 0, and your resolution is 0.01V, then 10.00 will correspond to a digital number 1000.\n",
    "\n",
    "Computers use binary (base 2) arithmetic internally, so it makes sense to think of *the number of bits (binary digits)* for an analog to digital conversion. E.g., $1024=2^{10}$ so an analog to digital conversion that ranges from 0 to 1000 requires a 10 bit binary number to represent the result. In fact, with 10 bits we can range from 0 (binary 0000000000) to 1023 (binary 1111111111). \n",
    "\n",
    "To represent negative numbers we often use the most significant bit (MSB) as a sign bit. However, noting that 1000000000 would be the same as 0000000000, thereby wasting a number, we use so-called \"2s complement binary\", where, e.g., 1111111111 is -512, 1000000000 is -1, and 0000000000 is zero, and 0111111111 is +511.\n",

    "### Flash converters\n",
    "\n",
    "Flash converters are the easiest to understand. The input analog voltage is compared to voltages generated using a resistive voltage divider. The comparisons are done in parallel (i.e., all at the same time) by a series of voltage comparators (which produce a 0 or 1 output depending on whether the input voltage is less than or greater than the comparison voltage). You need one comparator for every possible digital number. The output of the comparators is then examined by a logic circuit to generate the binary number.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](http://mcba11.phys.unsw.edu.au/~mcba/phys3112/adc-flash.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, the logic circuit is a bit smarter than just detecting the highest numbered comparator than has a 1 output. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](http://mcba11.phys.unsw.edu.au/~mcba/phys3112/Flash_ADC.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Flash converters can be very fast (since $2^n$ comparisons are made in the same time it takes to make one comparison), but also relatively expensive (since you need $2^n$ comparators). They tend to be used when very high-speed, but low-resolution, digitisation is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Successive approximate ADC\n",
    "\n",
    "The following figure (by White Flye - Own work, CC BY-SA 2.5) shows a successive approximation ADC.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](http://mcba11.phys.unsw.edu.au/~mcba/phys3112/SA_ADC_block_diagram.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Vin in the input voltage to be digitised. Vref is a stable reference voltage that sets the maximum output of the DAC. SAR is the successive approximation register. S/H is a sample and hold amplifier. DAC is a digital to analog converter. \"Clock\" is a square wave oscillation that sets the time interval for one comparison between the sampled input signal and the DAC output.\n",
    "\n",
    "For notes on analog to digital conversion [read this](http://www.analog.com/media/en/training-seminars/design-handbooks/Data-Conversion-Handbook/Chapter2.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Some interesting aspects of ADCs\n",
    "\n",
    "Discussed in lectures:\n",
    "\n",
    "- monotonicity; important for servo systems\n",
    "- bit errors can introduce large errors\n",
    "- in some cicumstances you can measure signals more accurately by adding noise!\n"
