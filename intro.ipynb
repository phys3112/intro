    "# Introducing Python and Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "by Michael Ashley for the course PHYS3112 at UNSW.\n",
    "\n",
    "What you are reading now is an example of a Jupyter Notebook. The basic concept is that of a \"notebook\" containing text and programming code. You can easily edit the notebook using your web browser. The notebook is stored on your computer, and your computer is acting as a web server in order to interact with the browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can run the programs in the notebook and see the output of the programs within the notebook. This is a powerful paradigm that is well suited to physics research, particularly when collaborating with other people.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Cells\" in a Jupyter Notebook are rectangular areas on the page that contain either text (such as this cell) or Python code (such as the simple examples in the following few cells).\n",
    "\n",
    "Text cells can be edited by *double-clicking* anywhere within the cell. Stop editing and display the text by pressing ctrl-ENTER (or shift-ENTER to also advance to the next cell).\n",
    "\n",
    "Code cells can be edited by *single clicking* anywhere within the cell. Execute the code by pressing ctrl-ENTER (or shift-ENTER to also advance to the next cell). The output from running the code is displayed immediately below the cell. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can also put text into a code cell as a comment (i.e., part of a program that is ignored by the computer when running it) by starting the line with the hash character: #. Actually, the hash can appear anywhere on a line, and the text following it, until the end of the line, is regarded as a comment.\n",
    "\n",
    "# How to use this Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "You can simply read this Notebook from beginning to end, but it is much more instructive to try editing it and explore what happens. You should experiment with changing the program code and running it. You can even start writing your own programs as you learn more.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The following cells show Python being used as a calculator\n",

Until recently, Python dictionaries were unordered, but they are now \"insertion ordered\", which means that they maintain the order in which they were constructed. Mathematically, a set does not have an order (i.e., {'a', 'b'} is exactly the same set as {'b', 'a'}, however, Python does allow you to specify that a set is ordered.\n",
